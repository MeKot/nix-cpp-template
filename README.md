# Nix + CMake template

1. Minimal devshell
2. `CMakeLists.txt` with some additional helpers in `cmake/`

NOTE: First time cmake is run for a template it will deliberately fail with helpful instructions.
Following those should land one with a quick walkthrough the cmake file and highlight all the
necessary project-specific things to edit.
